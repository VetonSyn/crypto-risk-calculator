Just a very simple crypto risk calculator based on R/R.
Enter your stoploss (percentage) and it will calculate your position size and margin required for crypto trading.

* Update

I have have added a Breakout prop firm lot size calculator. The data is live fetched from Bybit API.
For the moment it's working only for BTC, ETH and SOL
